//Instructions:
// Goal of this page is to initialize a user object for tracking/scoring. Gather information from the user, like name and other starting choices.
// Testing: write a tested function that takes a FormData instance and pulls relevant information to add to a user object which represents initial state (initialize numbers, objects, and/or arrays). Use a completed: {} property and object to track which quests or quiz question the user has completed.
// Use this function in the submit handler from the form to create your user object
// Save object to local storage
// Redirect to next step in the game

//set up main index.html page with form and ids needed
//get data (name, character selection) from user input in home page
const formData = document.getElementById('form');

//create a function that takes a single instance of form data and pulls out user information to create a user object. 



    //set initial state for carbon footprint tracking
    //set initial state for number of trees earned
    //tracks which quizzes the user has completed

//create an event handler with submit to create the user object. 
//save the user object to local storage
//redirect to the next quiz question
